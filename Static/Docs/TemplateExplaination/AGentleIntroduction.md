# ðŸ¦„ A Gentle Introduction

In my view, a feature is defined as a **self-contained unit of functionality** within an application. It should be easily testable and independent where possible. Applications are composed of **multiple features**, each with its own components, requirements, and dependencies, but typically there are **two types of features**:

- **Non-Functional Features**: These features focus on aspects like performance, security, or usability. Examples include caching or logging. While they don't directly affect the core functionality of the app, they are crucial for the system's overall health.

- **Functional Features**: These represent the main functionalities of the system, such as user logins, report generation, or data processing. These features directly impact how users interact with the application.

In larger projects, you may have hundreds of features. VSA stands out as an excellent choice because it organizes the codebase into **self-contained and independent feature modules**, which makes it easier to maintain and scale as the project grows.

However, **VSA is just an approach** to structure your code. It's up to you to implement it in a way that works best for your project.
